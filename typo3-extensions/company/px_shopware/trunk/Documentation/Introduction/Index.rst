Introduction
============

This extension connects the shopware_ shopsystem with TYPO3 CMS. It retrieves data from shopware REST-API_ and provides
many frontend plugins to show or list shopware data like articles, categories, etc on your TYPO3 website.

The extension was build from scratch and is based on a clean extensible architecture. Extbase and Fluid were used for
the implementation of the frontend plugins. Shopware data will be cached via TYPO3`s caching framework to prevent multiple
uneccessary API-Calls and also boost up the frontend rendering.
