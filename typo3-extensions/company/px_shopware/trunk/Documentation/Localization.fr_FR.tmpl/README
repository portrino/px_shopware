How to translate
================

This directory contains the French translation of your documentation.
This is a complete Sphinx project but you may reuse assets from the
main documentation under Documentation/.

If you plan to translate your documentation to French, you should
rename this directory and remove the suffix ".tmpl":

Localization.fr_FR.tmpl -> Localization.fr_FR

As this file is not needed either, feel free to delete it as well.


Supported languages
===================

Please visit http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/config.html#intl-options for a
list of languages supported by Sphinx.

Please note however that TYPO3 is using locales so you may need to
extend the language code from Sphinx into a proper locale to be used
by TYPO3.
